# MealyFSMGenerator ([Mealy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_machine))
> version: [0.1.0](https://github.com/hanbo1990/FSMGenerator/tree/master)

This mealy state machine generator will **generates c code together with its unit test** from [draw.io](https://www.draw.io) graph. The generator is written in a modular way, so it can easily extended to support other languages and other input sources.

Key words used in the state machine generator are **state**, **condition** and **transition function**. It can describe the mealy state machine behavior: In state A, condition occurs, state machine should call a transition function and go to state B.

## How to use:

### Prerequisites
- pip3 install bs4
- sudo apt-get install python3-lxml

### Step 1: Create the state machine graph. 

State machine in draw.io can be created following the example given in below:

![Example](https://i.postimg.cc/SQVM4Tzx/example.png)

Patterns to follow:
> 1. States should start with unique number
> 2. Condition should start with unique number
> 3. Transition with single direction arrow should start from one state to another state. 
> 4. Each transition line should come with condition and transition function in a new line.
> 5. Condition and transition function must be created on the transition line (not creating a text and move to the line).

Once the graph is generated, use drawio build-in export function to export the graph in xml format by:

```
File->Export As->xml
```
**Ｍake sure don't select compressed.**

### Step 2: Generate the code

By calling:
```
main.py -i <pathToXML> -n <StateMachineName>
```

After this step, you should be able to find the result in **Result** folder where you execute the main file.

### Step 3: Execute Unit Test

In Result/unit_test/ folder, execute following command:
```
ceedling
```
You should not see any reported error.

The Unit test is based on [ceedling](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/ceedling) which checks:
> 1. If the state number is same as the one in the graph. 
> 2. If the condition number is same as the one in the graph.
> 3. If the transition function is the same as the one in the graph.
> 4. Size of the Transition table is not changed.
> 5. The transition parameters (state, condition, next state, transition function) is same as the one in the graph. 

By enabling this unit_test, any manual change (exception is filling in the function slots) to the generated files will trigger a unit test failure.
